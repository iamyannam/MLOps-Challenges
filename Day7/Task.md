The xFusionCorp Industries deployment team needs the fraud-detection model code packaged as an installable Python distribution. A draft pyproject.toml exists at /root/code/fraud-detection/, but it does not build a wheel that meets the team's standard. Correct the file and produce a compliant package.


The project at /root/code/fraud-detection/ already contains the source code under src/fraud_detection/. The Python files are complete—you do not need to modify any of them.

The corrected pyproject.toml must satisfy every one of the following:

it declares a [build-system] section with requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "wheel"] and build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta";
name is fraud_detection (the distribution name must match the module path under src/);
version is 0.1.0;
requires-python is >=3.10;
dependencies is ["scikit-learn", "pandas", "numpy"].
Review the existing pyproject.toml and correct everything that does not match the requirements above.

Build the package from the project directory:

   cd /root/code/fraud-detection
   python3 -m build

The build must produce a wheel named fraud_detection-0.1.0-*.whl under dist/.
The build package is already installed. Use python3 rather than python.
