The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team requires data-schema contracts for every batch that feeds the fraud-detector model. It is essential to identify malformed rows upstream of the training process, rather than three hours later in production. A Great Expectations project has already been initialized at /root/code/dataquality/gx/, featuring a pandas data source that reads from data/transactions.csv, an empty fraud_schema suite, and a default checkpoint configured to publish results to Data Docs with each run. Your task is to populate the suite with four expectations and execute the checkpoint to ensure that Data Docs reflects a green status for these expectations.

The platform's data contract for a transactions batch is:
+  Schema — every batch must carry exactly these columns: amount, hour, num_tx_past_day, is_fraud.
+  amount — a transaction amount; it is never negative.
+  hour — the hour-of-day the transaction occurred.
+  is_fraud — a binary label.

/root/code/dataquality/author_expectations.py carries four numbered TODOs, each naming the Great Expectations class that encodes one contract rule (imports for great_expectations as gx and great_expectations.expectations as ge are already in place):
+  TODO 1: ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet — the required column set.
+  TODO 2: ExpectColumnValuesToBeBetween on amount.
+  TODO 3: ExpectColumnValuesToBeBetween on hour.
+  TODO 4: ExpectColumnValuesToBeInSet on is_fraud.

Running the script persists the suite to disk (gx/expectations/fraud_schema.json) and executes the default checkpoint, which validates transactions.csv against the suite and refreshes the Data Docs site. Data Docs is available from the Data Docs button at the top of the lab (port 8081), where each fraud_schema run renders with a green or red pill per expectation.

The end state must include:
+  gx/expectations/fraud_schema.json has all four expectations by type (expect_table_columns_to_match_set, two expect_column_values_to_be_between entries – One per column — and expect_column_values_to_be_in_set).
+  Each expectation's kwargs encode the data contract above.
+  The most recent validation JSON under gx/uncommitted/validations/ has success: true.
+  The Data Docs index page served on :8081 references fraud_schema.

>  Great Expectations treats data quality as code—expectation suites are versioned artefacts in the same repo as the model that consumes the data, run by the same CI that runs pytest. A run's result JSON is machine-readable (a downstream CI-gate lab consumes it), and Data Docs is the human-readable rendering of the same content. This task lays the ground for both.

"""Author the fraud_schema expectation suite and run the default checkpoint.

Startup has already initialised the Great Expectations project,
registered a pandas data source over ``data/transactions.csv``,
created an empty ``fraud_schema`` suite, and wired it into a
``default`` checkpoint that refreshes Data Docs on every run. The
only missing piece is the expectations themselves -- add them in
the TODO block below, then execute the file.
