"""Training script for the fraud-detection model.

This scaffold is deliberately non-deterministic — running it twice
produces different metrics on the same input data. A reproducibility
fix is required so downstream tooling (checksum-based caching,
experiment comparison, audit trails) can rely on run-to-run
stability.

Every non-reproducibility concern is already handled here — data
loading, split, training, MLflow logging, model persistence, and
metrics serialisation. Edit this file to add the seed discipline
that makes the run reproducible; do not change anything else.
